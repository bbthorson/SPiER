Speaker 1  0:00  
It's. Foreign

Speaker 2  0:13  
whenever we train in a collaborative assessment and management suicidality, we make a big deal of showing what it looks like and sounds like. So this next phase of this training, we're going to show you a role play clinical demonstration of the use of cams over the course of 12 sessions. What

Unknown Speaker  0:30  
you're about to see is session one. And

Speaker 2  0:34  
one of the issues that many clinicians have is, how do you get into this? How do you identify suicidal risk so quickly? At the beginning of the session? In my practice, I use a screening tool so that I have some inkling that somebody has suicidal thoughts on board, even before I see them in the first session. But if you're adhered to the cams model, you are listening for distress, significant distress, to identify that risk early on, the case you're about to see is a typical outpatient who's at significant risk for suicide, very preoccupied with suicide over many years. Let's watch how I initially engage the patient. Pursue discussions around his level of distress, flush out the fact that there is suicidal thinking on board, introduce the notion of using the suicide status form as a means of better understanding

Speaker 3  1:28  
that's suicidal risk and is completed

Speaker 2  1:32  
collaboratively, sitting side by side with the patient taking the lead. The patient actually fills out the first page of the SSF. You'll see me assisting and supporting and clarifying as we go. When done adherently, section A is completed in about 20 minutes the session then transitions to Section B, still sitting side by side, I take back the clipboard, and we work our way through critical warning signs and risk factors that lead up to our collaborative treatment planning effort. Section C. The non negotiable. First problem is the potential for self harm if we're truly going to be able to keep a highly suicidal person out of the hospital, we move quickly to development of a stabilization.

Speaker 2  2:27  
Reducing access, lethal means, developing problem solving, decreasing isolation, identifying barriers to care. And then we transition into the identification of two problems we call drivers in cams, those problems in the patient's mind that compel them to consider suicide as a way of getting their needs met. Let's watch as I initially engage the patient.

Unknown Speaker  2:55  
So Kevin, what brings you in today?

Unknown Speaker  3:01  
I mean, I don't know. I mean,

Speaker 4  3:07  
I don't even know if I if I would have really come in if my girlfriend didn't

Unknown Speaker  3:12  
kind of kind of push me in. But I guess, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  3:20  
things have been kind of rough lately. Your

Speaker 5  3:23  
girlfriend pushed you in? Yeah, she was kind of like, she's

Speaker 4  3:27  
kind of like, if you don't come in, basically you gotta get that out of the house.

Unknown Speaker  3:34  
She was like, coming here or don't come back.

Unknown Speaker  3:39  
What are her concerns about you?

Unknown Speaker  3:43  
I don't know. I don't really know.

Unknown Speaker  3:48  
Yeah, we fight a lot, but

Speaker 6  3:53  
I don't really know why this is, why this is different.

Unknown Speaker  3:57  
We got him a big fight.

Unknown Speaker  4:01  
We had a big fight yesterday, and

Speaker 4  4:04  
I guess something feels different for big fun. Yeah,

Speaker 5  4:12  
I was pissed off that she left and she went out,

Speaker 4  4:17  
and she said she was going out with some of her friends, but I'm pretty sure

Speaker 5  4:21  
that she was trying to find this other day. And

Unknown Speaker  4:27  
she came home, and, you know, I really

Unknown Speaker  4:34  
tried to make it a point for how much I was

Unknown Speaker  4:36  
pissed off about that, and

Unknown Speaker  4:40  
she started crying, and

Speaker 1  4:45  
she was like, you keep that appointment or don't

Unknown Speaker  4:50  
come back. The relationship sounds

Unknown Speaker  4:52  
like it's been

Unknown Speaker  4:54  
rocky for a while. Yeah, we have a

Speaker 2  5:00  
what's at the heart of the conflict is it? Is it your concerns about her seeing someone else, or is it

Unknown Speaker  5:05  
a whole bunch of stuff? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  5:07  
that flags for me. I just feel like when

Unknown Speaker  5:11  
I get I just don't know if I can trust her all the time.

Unknown Speaker  5:21  
So what to do to you? I

Unknown Speaker  5:25  
i Get Real wrecked, like I get real, I

Unknown Speaker  5:30  
don't know, I just feel like I'm just sitting there and I

Unknown Speaker  5:35  
just yeah, that feeling where it's like you just want to,

Unknown Speaker  5:37  
like, jump out of your skin, kind of thing.

Unknown Speaker  5:40  
I feel really bad.

Speaker 1  5:41  
I don't I I

Unknown Speaker  5:46  
don't, I don't feel like myself.

Speaker 2  5:52  
You know, you did an intake when you first came in, and which rating scales, and those are all different symptoms. Yeah, there's a range of stuff, yeah. So how bad does it get for you? I mean, how distressed or jumping on your skin do you get? I mean,

Unknown Speaker  6:11  
what's what's bad?

Speaker 2  6:14  
Some people feel like they're going crazy. Some people feel like they could kill themselves, everything in between.

Unknown Speaker  6:21  
Where do you land? I

Speaker 4  6:26  
mean, I guess, I guess there are times when it gets, yeah, there are times when it gets

Speaker 5  6:30  
so bad where I kind of want to kill myself. And

Speaker 2  6:35  
when you think about that, Kevin, does it? Does it comfort you? Does it upset you? Is it a soothing thought? Does it? Is it like

Unknown Speaker  6:41  
a way to get back at your girlfriend?

Unknown Speaker  6:43  
What's that like?

Unknown Speaker  6:44  
I guess.

Unknown Speaker  6:47  
I guess kind of both like,

Unknown Speaker  6:54  
like yesterday,

Speaker 4  6:57  
when I was pretty convinced that I couldn't trust her and that she was lying to me and stuff

Unknown Speaker  7:00  
like that. I was like, I was

Unknown Speaker  7:02  
pretty convinced that

Speaker 4  7:06  
if I killed myself, it would really stick it to her, like she'd really but she I don't think she does understand how bad things get from you, and

Unknown Speaker  7:20  
she knew yesterday, I guess I

Unknown Speaker  7:25  
yesterday. This something

Unknown Speaker  7:28  
particularly happened yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  7:34  
Yeah, so

Unknown Speaker  7:37  
she went out,

Speaker 4  7:39  
and her mom was out too. We live so we live at

Unknown Speaker  7:43  
we live in her mom's house, and

Speaker 7  7:53  
I thought a lot about what it would be like if she came home

Unknown Speaker  7:59  
or something.

Unknown Speaker  8:01  
I have those thoughts from time to time. Like, yeah. Like, if

Unknown Speaker  8:07  
I ship she just came home and saw you your body, yeah?

Unknown Speaker  8:10  
Or, like,

Speaker 4  8:14  
what if I shot myself in the head on the doorstep? Like,

Unknown Speaker  8:17  
if they come home,

Speaker 5  8:20  
they get it right. Like, so yesterday, I

Speaker 4  8:27  
we, we have these kitchen knives, and I took this knife,

Unknown Speaker  8:32  
I kind of propped it up,

Speaker 4  8:35  
and I kind of took these two chairs and this like stack of books, and I started doing push ups over it,

Unknown Speaker  8:43  
because I thought,

Unknown Speaker  8:46  
like, why wouldn't this be a funny thing? Of like,

Speaker 4  8:50  
she'd come home and see this when my strength gives out, like, I don't have the strength anymore kind of thing. And there I'd be, and then she'd realize that

Unknown Speaker  8:59  
maybe I whisper around too much, or,

Speaker 2  9:04  
all right, so lock on, obviously here, and it sounds like the fantasy is not the first time you've had these thoughts,

Unknown Speaker  9:15  
kind of like, I'll show you about killing myself, yeah, yeah. So

Speaker 2  9:21  
what I what I think about that is, is that we might want to take a look at that, because it's a pretty extreme thing. It would definitely make an impact. There's

Unknown Speaker  9:29  
no doubt about it. But

Speaker 2  9:33  
at the same time, the need for her to see how distressed you

Unknown Speaker  9:38  
are is legitimate. I

Unknown Speaker  9:39  
want the best to cost you a lot. But

Unknown Speaker  9:45  
in any case,

Speaker 2  9:47  
when I get into a discussion around suicide risk, there's a assessment that I'd really like to do that helps us understand a bit more about how things

Unknown Speaker  9:57  
have gotten to this place

Speaker 2  10:00  
and before you would kill yourself, it would seem to me to be worthwhile,

Speaker 5  10:03  
to come Well, I think that all three, does that make sense?

Unknown Speaker  10:11  
I guess. I mean, I don't know how I know how it's gonna make that much

Unknown Speaker  10:14  
of a difference. Well, you're here. I

Unknown Speaker  10:19  
mean, you see my next guy and stuff. But

Unknown Speaker  10:21  
I don't, I don't, well, I get that

Unknown Speaker  10:25  
so memory.

Unknown Speaker  10:27  
Let's do this assessment together and see kind

Unknown Speaker  10:29  
of what we discover.

Speaker 2  10:32  
And you know, to see how that plays, and you can decide whether this is something you want to look into further or just do a one session

Unknown Speaker  10:42  
encounter. Okay, that's fair. Okay,

Speaker 2  10:44  
so it's a an assessment I use pretty regularly, regularly with a lot of my patients. It's actually a tool that helps us kind of look at what is going on for you and to complete it. I actually help you complete it, and it's okay take a seat next to you. Why? Why are you nice? Because we're gonna do it together. This is not something where I just want you to fill it out. I want to actually walk you through it and help you understand and together figure out the best the best way to respond that reflects what

Unknown Speaker  11:18  
it's like for you. I Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  11:21  
sure. So here we go. I'm just

Unknown Speaker  11:23  
gonna move my seat. That's okay. So

Unknown Speaker  11:30  
what this all right? Yep, you do the right.

Speaker 2  11:35  
What this assessment tool does is walk us through different kinds of considerations, like this first time, the psychological pain. Now you got in a huge fight yesterday, and you've been fighting a lot. But as you sit here with me right now, how would you rate your emotional, psychological pain?

Unknown Speaker  11:55  
One, being no pain. Five, being out of your skin.

Unknown Speaker  12:03  
Right now, right maybe,

Unknown Speaker  12:10  
maybe four, okay, I don't feel as

Unknown Speaker  12:12  
bad as I did. Yes, okay.

Unknown Speaker  12:14  
And right here, what do you find most painful when you are I

Unknown Speaker  12:22  
don't even know how to

Unknown Speaker  12:23  
answer that. Whatever comes to me.

Unknown Speaker  12:33  
Hey, stuck my own skin.

Unknown Speaker  12:36  
That's the only thing I can really think of right now.

Unknown Speaker  12:40  
So we do this

Speaker 2  12:43  
as you see her with me right now, low stress, high stress, worthy, perpetual.

Unknown Speaker  12:47  
Judge yourself to be who's right now again, yeah, you

Speaker 7  12:54  
don't want to be here, so yeah, I mean, no offense. I hope you gotta take this wrong way. But None taken. It's five because

Unknown Speaker  12:59  
I'm here, yeah?

Unknown Speaker  13:04  
Like, I kind of want to, I

Unknown Speaker  13:06  
feel like I'm kind of fighting myself and not

Speaker 1  13:09  
running out the door. Yeah, I'm glad you're not running out the door just yet. Next

Speaker 2  13:17  
question is about agitation. This is a sense of urgency, like it can explode. You have

Unknown Speaker  13:22  
to do something,

Speaker 2  13:24  
and that can be very low. Levels of agitation are extremely high. How would you remove yourself

Unknown Speaker  13:32  
feeling like I need to take action? I don't

Unknown Speaker  13:38  
know if I really get that.

Unknown Speaker  13:42  
This is just a sense of urgency.

Unknown Speaker  13:45  
You got to do something. Feel

Unknown Speaker  13:46  
something? Feel like, like

Unknown Speaker  13:48  
a restlessness, yeah,

Speaker 2  13:51  
so it's not a right or wrong answer. We're just trying to get a sense of especially when do you feel like you need to take action?

Speaker 7  13:58  
Okay? Like a slash, sure. Feel like I'm like, slash four, slash five. That's fine, because I feel like, right now I don't like, I feel like I'm not go, Yeah, but it

Speaker 4  14:10  
doesn't feel the same. It's like yesterday, like

Unknown Speaker  14:17  
yesterday was feeling like

Unknown Speaker  14:20  
someone does something untrustworthy, okay?

Speaker 1  14:22  
I so

Speaker 2  14:25  
that might be hard here in terms of trusting a mental health professional,

Unknown Speaker  14:31  
we should keep your event

Speaker 2  14:33  
therapy, no. So that would be very common that someone would be sort of wary

Unknown Speaker  14:38  
about this. Kevin just

Unknown Speaker  14:40  
got, like, trust and stuff, yeah, even a mental health

Speaker 8  14:42  
professional, especially a mental health professional, I a mental health professional,

Unknown Speaker  14:47  
yeah question,

Unknown Speaker  14:50  
no sure. How

Unknown Speaker  14:53  
would you rate your hopelessness? One being,

Unknown Speaker  14:57  
no hopelessness. Five being,

Unknown Speaker  15:04  
I wish you you

Unknown Speaker  15:06  
could use a few more numbers on this one. What number would you put,

Speaker 7  15:10  
I don't know, on your one to five scale here, yeah, maybe, like a,

Unknown Speaker  15:15  
I probably I paid you, like a six or

Speaker 1  15:17  
10, okay, putting on my page. All right, I'll give you a 10. Okay. Is there anything

Unknown Speaker  15:23  
in particular? You're hopeless,

Unknown Speaker  15:27  
everything like I'm I don't think anything.

Unknown Speaker  15:35  
Next one is question about self hate.

Speaker 2  15:41  
How would you rate that low salt plate with another 10.

Unknown Speaker  15:46  
So you're, you're really not loving

Speaker 2  15:50  
your experiments. You're, you're like you said. You're being stuck in one skin. Is really well known? Is there anything in particular that you hate about

Speaker 1  16:02  
yourself? All right, I don't even know how to answer that. I everything,

Unknown Speaker  16:23  
yeah, man, I guess so. I mean,

Speaker 4  16:28  
right now, anyway, I'm having a hard time finding something that I don't eat. So yeah, I guess everything sounds as good an answer. This

Speaker 2  16:42  
is just how this goes. It really helps me get a sense of what so what's on board with you? The next thing I want you to do is to rank order these. Kevin, from one being the thing that weighs on you

Unknown Speaker  16:51  
the most is most

Unknown Speaker  16:52  
to five being used important

Speaker 2  16:58  
only you know most important like heavy to you, heavy that weighs on you, that upsets you. I go,

Unknown Speaker  17:09  
I go to add something.

Speaker 4  17:14  
Okay, this is, this is like a close second, but it feels like right there. Yep, I don't know if I wanted to maybe, like one and a half, maybe even like a tie for one, okay? 345, I

Speaker 4  17:32  
mean this pain stuff and the hopelessness feels all together, so that probably makes sense. Maybe this and then stress right now, I don't want to be here, but that's not unknown

Speaker 1  17:41  
all the time. Okay? I so

Speaker 2  17:45  
big question, this last one here, five is I'm gonna kill myself, and one being, I'm not gonna kill myself.

Unknown Speaker  18:01  
Now, did you want to get it? Yeah? You can trust

Unknown Speaker  18:11  
me. Seriously, you

Speaker 2  18:12  
signed a form out in the waiting room about the law, and I made reference to it. My goal would be to keep a patient out of the hospital, even if they're seriously suicide, if possible. Can't break the law, but there's a lot we can do, and I

Unknown Speaker  18:27  
got a very high partial.

Unknown Speaker  18:30  
So I do want to in this response

Unknown Speaker  18:31  
to this question, I don't

Speaker 4  18:35  
know if I want to give you my because i You're right. I I skinned that form

Unknown Speaker  18:39  
over and all that. But yeah,

Speaker 3  18:42  
so here's the thing. Well, I don't want you to either.

Speaker 2  18:47  
So here's the thing for sure, if you come back after this session, this doesn't work. You don't trust me. If you can't be honest with

Unknown Speaker  18:53  
me, we're both wasting our time. So I need an honest answer,

Unknown Speaker  18:56  
and I'm asking you to

Speaker 2  19:00  
imagine the prospect of a clinician being able to tolerate an honest answer

Unknown Speaker  19:08  
so he's not going to react unduly.

Speaker 5  19:13  
Those are some very nice words, and not just words, but

Unknown Speaker  19:23  
let's roll the dice.

Unknown Speaker  19:27  
So you're in

Unknown Speaker  19:31  
a lot of distress.

Unknown Speaker  19:32  
That's how I take that.

Speaker 2  19:35  
And everything about what we're doing here is designed to figure out what is the cause of that distress, and what we can do to treat that distress, and whether you choose to pursue that or not

Speaker 5  19:46  
is really up to you, and we can sort of feel our way through that as we go.

Unknown Speaker  19:54  
Any questions?

Speaker 2  20:02  
Okay, so the next items here is our questions about how much is being suicidal related to you, and how much is it related to

Unknown Speaker  20:11  
be about other people? Would you rate

Speaker 2  20:17  
got complicated girlfriend, your self hate thing seems to be really pronounced.

Unknown Speaker  20:22  
Would you read these respectively,

Unknown Speaker  20:26  
about use, about the people? Oh, neither does

Unknown Speaker  20:30  
it have to balance out like,

Speaker 4  20:33  
it's not like they add up to five or nothing, Nope, just whatever rings true to you,

Unknown Speaker  20:39  
four and four. Okay, the

Speaker 2  20:42  
next items here, Kevin, are actually questions about reasons that

Speaker 5  20:46  
you'd want to live and reasons for dying, and

Unknown Speaker  20:51  
there's no right or wrong answer, but

Unknown Speaker  20:53  
you have reasons for living and reasons for

Unknown Speaker  20:58  
dying. I know I got reasons for

Speaker 4  20:59  
dying. Can you start there? If you'd like all right,

Unknown Speaker  21:09  
people don't get it. That's what

Speaker 5  21:13  
I'm thinking about up here. It's like, I don't really

Speaker 1  21:18  
like myself very much. When you said your girlfriend doesn't get it

Unknown Speaker  21:24  
that she didn't get how bad things are. She doesn't really.

Unknown Speaker  21:28  
Maybe I'll take this one step further and

Unknown Speaker  21:31  
say they don't care,

Unknown Speaker  21:35  
like she doesn't get it or

Unknown Speaker  21:38  
she doesn't care. Just doesn't,

Unknown Speaker  21:42  
doesn't flag. My knees don't play.

Unknown Speaker  21:43  
This is register with her. It sounds

Unknown Speaker  21:46  
like yeah, she doesn't.

Unknown Speaker  21:49  
Yeah, no, they don't.

Unknown Speaker  21:53  
Other reasons for time,

Unknown Speaker  21:59  
nothing's gonna change. That goes back to the hopelessness i Okay,

Unknown Speaker  22:07  
contribute to society or

Unknown Speaker  22:16  
anything. Okay?

Unknown Speaker  22:28  
We call that networks, perceived burden,

Unknown Speaker  22:32  
this burden

Speaker 8  22:33  
on people who care for you. I mean, I

Unknown Speaker  22:39  
don't know how that makes sense together, because sometimes I

Unknown Speaker  22:41  
feel like I'm the you

Unknown Speaker  22:48  
feel right? Any other reasons for time?

Speaker 5  23:00  
No. How about Reese's for

Unknown Speaker  23:14  
living room? Maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  23:23  
I mean, I guess,

Unknown Speaker  23:35  
I guess my mom would be pretty

Unknown Speaker  23:42  
upset she's talking

Unknown Speaker  23:45  
to me. Comes to mind. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  23:49  
I guess maybe

Unknown Speaker  23:51  
this doesn't really feel too true, but maybe something

Unknown Speaker  23:54  
will get better. That's

Speaker 2  24:01  
interesting isn't when it feels like what you're most hopeless about is everything, nothing's gonna change.

Speaker 1  24:06  
Somebody's a little tiny part of you, tiny, tiny, tiny. Is

Unknown Speaker  24:11  
it completely convinced? Maybe not.

Unknown Speaker  24:15  
I feel like if I really, then I really don't.

Unknown Speaker  24:19  
I mean, what? Why? Correct?

Unknown Speaker  24:22  
So I feel like I'm gonna check out if I don't

Unknown Speaker  24:26  
force myself to think that maybe something understood is this One.

Unknown Speaker  24:37  
Yeah, I got one more.

Unknown Speaker  24:41  
It's really stupid. I uh,

Unknown Speaker  24:46  
have you ever seen

Unknown Speaker  24:48  
you ever watched that TV show Breaking Bad?

Speaker 2  24:51  
You ever hear that one? I've heard it. I haven't watched it.

Speaker 7  24:55  
I know about it. I've been I've been starting to watch it, and

Speaker 4  25:02  
I really do want to see how it ends. People tells me it kind of ends like it's the best show or something like that. And I feel like I really want to see what they are talking about. They're done.

Unknown Speaker  25:12  
And that is not a stupid response. Now, if

Speaker 2  25:20  
you were to rank order these like you rank ordered above, hold your rank order, your reasons for living, reasons for dying, respectively,

Speaker 8  25:29  
the one that weighs in you the most. And this is

Unknown Speaker  25:35  
what feels really stupid, because I feel like I throw a breaking bad

Unknown Speaker  25:38  
in that one spot. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  25:41  
so how it then these are, like, far

Speaker 4  25:46  
less relevant, yeah, I guess I'll go, I don't really like my mom very much, so I guess I'll throw,

Unknown Speaker  25:51  
okay, throw it like that.

Unknown Speaker  25:54  
And I'm this side.

Speaker 7  25:58  
There's another one weird. I feel like I throw these guys at a tie that people don't get it.

Speaker 3  26:03  
They beat it. I care about.

Unknown Speaker  26:14  
Throw that there. I'll throw that there.

Unknown Speaker  26:16  
Maybe I know this would be three, four.

Unknown Speaker  26:21  
yeah, we're doing.

Unknown Speaker  26:28  
I feel like, like

Speaker 3  26:32  
it's helping to play catch up a little bit, helping me understand what you want

Unknown Speaker  26:41  
to go through that's so given

Speaker 3  26:44  
this next one, your wish to die. What's your wish?

Unknown Speaker  27:01  
It one and four good

Speaker 2  27:09  
loss when it comes to this stuff. No one knows this more. I'm better than you. I'm just trying to get a sense of it through your eyes. Last question, what's the one thing that would have to change for you not to be suicidal?

Unknown Speaker  27:24  
If I could just or just to choose something? Can

Unknown Speaker  27:27  
we take it off the table? I don't

Speaker 4  27:37  
think there's anything that you can do. I feel like the answer that's kind of coming to my mind is something that's like,

Unknown Speaker  27:45  
really impossible. Okay. Well,

Speaker 4  27:54  
do you you ever see that movie Men in Black? You know how in that movie, they have that flash thing?

Unknown Speaker  28:01  
I feel like it would

Unknown Speaker  28:05  
be if I could go through everyone who's ever met me

Unknown Speaker  28:09  
flash

Speaker 7  28:11  
and then flash myself struggle so that I can.

Unknown Speaker  28:19  
And I don't remember.

Speaker 3  28:22  
My, then I feel like maybe my life would be.

Unknown Speaker  28:28  
Men in Black Flash thing,

Speaker 3  28:29  
I can't remember that. what that's called, Note that since every

Speaker 6  28:33  
difference, right, they have summary. piece

Unknown Speaker  28:52  
of it feels like

Speaker 4  28:55  
you don't want people to remember know you as they do, and you don't want that either

Unknown Speaker  29:04  
any questions.

Speaker 8  29:07  
So I'm gonna actually take this back. That's okay. I've got a little bit more to

Unknown Speaker  29:16  
go all right, so we've learned since

Speaker 6  29:23  
the most I can ask

Unknown Speaker  29:28  
this next part actually helps get a

Unknown Speaker  29:30  
little bit more clarity about

Unknown Speaker  29:35  
particularly,

Unknown Speaker  29:48  
yeah, I

Unknown Speaker  29:50  
think about suicide a lot, okay? And have you

Unknown Speaker  29:53  
thought for a lifetime, or

Unknown Speaker  29:55  
more recently, for a long time,

Unknown Speaker  30:02  
since I was about seven, since seven,

Speaker 2  30:07  
and when you think about it, is it every day? Is it like a weekly thing. It's every day, every day. And is it a flash, or is it like a, a two hour

Unknown Speaker  30:16  
vacation? I feel like

Unknown Speaker  30:19  
it could be both

Unknown Speaker  30:22  
seconds, minutes, hours, maybe,

Speaker 4  30:28  
maybe both. Maybe like, I like, sometimes I get like a,

Unknown Speaker  30:33  
sometimes I get like a,

Speaker 9  30:35  
be so much easier if I was dead. Sometimes I get like, oh, I should just kill myself. Sometimes I

Speaker 5  30:40  
think about like, maybe for like an hour, like, how much better it would be and how much,

Speaker 2  30:49  
yeah, that gives me a sense of I almost had a patient who had like a neon light

Unknown Speaker  30:52  
in his mind, suicide, suicide.

Unknown Speaker  30:57  
Do you have a plan

Unknown Speaker  31:05  
like I feel like,

Unknown Speaker  31:07  
what to to do? What to I

Unknown Speaker  31:21  
narrow down. It's

Unknown Speaker  31:26  
kind of hard

Unknown Speaker  31:29  
to narrow up to

Unknown Speaker  31:35  
Say, table I see Like and I

Speaker 3  32:15  
dependence, like, why would you

Unknown Speaker  32:28  
Just tell me what's called?

Unknown Speaker  32:35  
And she got, I

Unknown Speaker  32:36  
don't know, she was just like,

Speaker 3  32:42  
let it go, just like you like, when I hear that stuff, I get really

Speaker 4  32:49  
deal, like, it is a big deal. And so then when she left, I was like, she

Unknown Speaker  32:54  
she doesn't get it. She doesn't she

Unknown Speaker  32:57  
didn't really understand it. So

Unknown Speaker  33:00  
bad it is for you, yeah? She doesn't

Unknown Speaker  33:03  
upset you, yeah. So what'd you do? Well,

Unknown Speaker  33:11  
I got, I went upstairs.

Speaker 4  33:15  
We live, we live in her mom's house in the basement right now and and

Unknown Speaker  33:28  
I propped the knife up.

Speaker 6  33:30  
It down in the ground, sort of propped it up. Then I grabbed these started pretty much coming home, 64

Unknown Speaker  33:39  
push on the chair. It

Unknown Speaker  33:46  
sounds kind of like a,

Speaker 4  33:47  
sort of like, like we come home and see

Unknown Speaker  33:51  
or my should get off. I

Unknown Speaker  34:02  
play push ups when she came home, like what I'm

Unknown Speaker  34:53  
Can she get I don't know. She's just like,

Speaker 4  34:59  
like, just let it go. Just let it go. It's not a big deal. Like, when I hear that stuff, I get kind of rubbed. I was like, it's not a big deal. Like, it is a big deal. And so then when she left, I was like, she

Unknown Speaker  35:11  
she doesn't get it. She doesn't she

Unknown Speaker  35:14  
doesn't really understand it. So

Speaker 8  35:17  
how bad it is for you. Yeah, helps out you get, yeah.

Unknown Speaker  35:23  
So what you do? Well,

Unknown Speaker  35:28  
I got, I went upstairs.

Speaker 4  35:32  
We live, we live in her mom's house in the basement right now, and Mommy has a set of kitchen knives, and

Unknown Speaker  35:41  
went back downstairs to our kind

Unknown Speaker  35:42  
of apartment, and

Unknown Speaker  35:45  
I propped the knife up. I kind of like set it down in the

Speaker 1  35:48  
ground, sort of propped it up, then I grabbed these chairs.

Unknown Speaker  35:52  
Started about the time

Unknown Speaker  35:54  
I knew she was coming home like

Speaker 4  35:57  
five minutes before I started doing push ups on the chair,

Unknown Speaker  36:02  
over the night over the knife.

Speaker 1  36:10  
That's kind of like a, I guess, in the moment, like a race against the clock sort of thing,

Speaker 4  36:15  
like, would she come home and see or would my strength give out first?

Unknown Speaker  36:26  
Must be stronger than I think I

Unknown Speaker  36:30  
was still doing push ups

Unknown Speaker  36:31  
when she came home and she flipped out.

Unknown Speaker  36:36  
So

Speaker 2  36:38  
is that a recurrent thought, or would that be a plan that you've considered before, using a knife? Have your you have a gun? Have you thought hanging yourself? I hate to be so blunt, but I've

Unknown Speaker  36:48  
tried hanging myself.

Speaker 2  36:49  
Okay, we'll get to that. But, but do you have a gun? No, okay,

Speaker 4  36:54  
but obviously, knives. I've thought about shooting myself in the

Unknown Speaker  36:58  
head. I've thought about like,

Unknown Speaker  37:01  
you know, like, what if

Speaker 4  37:03  
there's, like, front, front porch, like, what if I shoot myself on the porch in the head, and then they come home and they just see, yeah, yeah. And then, then they'd

Speaker 8  37:11  
probably get it, so yeah, they would definitely that would make a impression. Okay, yeah.

Speaker 2  37:18  
So just, just to cut to the chase, you don't have a gun, but do you have a rope? You have knives or knives that

Unknown Speaker  37:25  
you have access to?

Unknown Speaker  37:26  
Yeah, I got knives. Stash of pills.

Unknown Speaker  37:30  
No, I'm not really on a mate,

Unknown Speaker  37:33  
okay, it's a medication in the house,

Unknown Speaker  37:37  
maybe, like Advil,

Speaker 2  37:38  
aspirin, something like that, so that the when and the where sounds like at home, and it sounds like it's very impersonal, that they walk into this scene and

Speaker 5  37:47  
find Your body, basically, it kind of clouds, okay? And

Unknown Speaker  37:58  
a knife. Do you have a rope?

Unknown Speaker  38:02  
No, but

Unknown Speaker  38:07  
I know I could hang myself a bunch of stuff, like a couple to go.

Unknown Speaker  38:16  
I trade this belt over this pull up bar.

Unknown Speaker  38:20  
Okay, so it

Speaker 2  38:25  
sounds like you actually have engaged in called preparation behavior Kevin and you have rehearsed so prepper shouldn't be sort of putting your affairs in order writing a suicide note? Have you ever written a suicide

Unknown Speaker  38:37  
note? Why not I

Unknown Speaker  38:40  
just want the statement to be that by. be advised,

Speaker 3  38:46  
you created situations. You

Unknown Speaker  38:52  
gone moving around, yeah,

Unknown Speaker  38:56  
and you literally

Unknown Speaker  38:59  
have you made a 10, four. I

Unknown Speaker  39:06  
You can consider

Unknown Speaker  39:10  
which it's pretty lethal. People will Be

Unknown Speaker  39:26  
and

Speaker 3  39:51  
you can the History wise, we don't follow

Speaker 2  40:21  
the because yourself is impulsive, other people

Unknown Speaker  40:25  
describe you as impulsive,

Unknown Speaker  40:29  
yeah, I guess so. I know my girlfriend would.

Unknown Speaker  40:32  
But I mean, as I'm kind of talking about you, Tracy, it didn't feel

Unknown Speaker  40:37  
like, kind of felt like that came out, yeah, I guess I would be, you have alcohol,

Unknown Speaker  40:46  
you don't drink alcohol, do drugs. I actually, I actually

Speaker 4  40:52  
have a hard time around people who do okay. That's something that my girlfriend and I fight about like another she's going out and drinking, even though she knows I have a hard time with it. It's like. it.

Unknown Speaker  41:06  
It's like, important, it's evil.

Unknown Speaker  41:15  
Can't think of anything,

Unknown Speaker  41:17  
relationship, friend,

Unknown Speaker  41:24  
but also the people most also

Speaker 3  41:30  
focused on your girlfriend you

Unknown Speaker  41:46  
I'm sorry to talk about This. You're feel like

Unknown Speaker  41:48  
you're burdened others, sometimes, sometimes,

Unknown Speaker  42:05  
you Oh, no, that's not overseeing me.

Unknown Speaker  42:08  
That kind of feels right, okay,

Unknown Speaker  42:13  
any health or pain issues,

Speaker 1  42:14  
physically, no, I'm doing pretty good, okay?

Unknown Speaker  42:20  
Any sleep issues, I

Unknown Speaker  42:24  
don't sleep very much. How

Unknown Speaker  42:25  
much do you sleep? Like

Unknown Speaker  42:27  
three, four hours in a real is that

Speaker 2  42:32  
typical? Yeah, it's pretty am. Do you ever have a full night sleep? Do you have troubles falling asleep or waking up early?

Unknown Speaker  42:40  
Both? Kind of both. Okay.

Unknown Speaker  42:44  
Any legal or financial issues? No.

Speaker 8  42:50  
I mean financial maybe. I mean I don't have a job. So how are you? How are you supporting yourself?

Unknown Speaker  42:59  
Well, I'm looking for jobs. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  43:03  
grandpa. And your

Unknown Speaker  43:07  
take all call this, this

Unknown Speaker  43:11  
is there no

Unknown Speaker  43:13  
shame. Shame, you said George and bear, bear. So

Unknown Speaker  43:15  
I mean,

Unknown Speaker  43:21  
I mean shame errors

Unknown Speaker  43:23  
meant they're kind of the same thing, thing,

Unknown Speaker  43:28  
cousins teacher that other people haven't

Speaker 3  43:31  
seen you go, Well, okay, so

Speaker 3  43:43  
you might know minute for you. All

Unknown Speaker  44:02  
right, so

Speaker 3  44:04  
we like I think, worried about

Unknown Speaker  44:11  
do whatever is a treatment

Unknown Speaker  44:14  
for the circumstances that you're in

Speaker 3  44:17  
and everything that you've described. It's, it's, it's Graham I get understands like

Speaker 2  44:23  
and don't trust people. You're very worried at this process, but at the same time, I'm learning things that actually we can treat if, oh yeah, but whether you're up for that is another point of discussion. But the thing about this intervention is, if we're

Speaker 9  44:43  
going to keep you out of the hospital, which is a shared goal, right? Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  44:47  
I don't want to go there. Me too.

Speaker 3  44:50  
You're talking about some pretty serious things. So very about

Unknown Speaker  44:58  
and the way that I

Speaker 2  44:59  
am most comfortable working to keep hospital is develop a stabilization

Speaker 3  45:07  
plan. What do we do between if you were we need

Unknown Speaker  45:23  
it's the first item on the treatment plan.

Speaker 2  45:28  
And then the other thing, Kevin, with this particular intervention that we're considering, and hope you'll consider, is the two problems that put your life most at risk, and this intervention that we call cams, those two problems we are actually are we think of as drivers, the things that can that make suicide sort of irresistible. And if we can define what your drivers are, we can read drivers. There's lots of ways to treat drivers so that maybe you don't have to kill yourself. So the treatment plan that we're considering is a stabilization plan that's comforts me and you, so

Unknown Speaker  46:09  
that hospitalization is not yet required,

Speaker 2  46:14  
and identifying two problems that we call drivers, and we're not targeted drivers in the course of

Speaker 3  46:22  
maybe 12 sessions.

Unknown Speaker  46:27  
You think, I can, you think I think I can make time stuff up and

Unknown Speaker  46:32  
really, oh yeah.

Unknown Speaker  46:34  
I mean that experience. And I'm not

Speaker 3  46:36  
ignoring this intervention, most people will respond, you know, just talking about, we're in a really, really, really dark place, but I pitch everything beginning Would,

Unknown Speaker  47:00  
is certain. My question to you,

Speaker 2  47:04  
and if we can treat the things that put your life in peril and help you for stabilize

Unknown Speaker  47:10  
you have to kill yourself, maybe there's another way to get your needs met.

Speaker 2  47:18  
That's an interesting Well, that's the point. Is to give you pause so

Speaker 4  47:25  
you humor me and press on through with this. Yeah, I

Speaker 3  47:29  
kind of hear this going, Okay, well, where it's going is

Speaker 2  47:34  
legality, so we cannot have you set up a situation where you're going to do push ups over a knife. Can we secure

Unknown Speaker  47:43  
those knives or get them out of reach from you?

Speaker 2  47:50  
What does that mean? It means they've got to be put someplace, where they are on TV. It

Unknown Speaker  47:56  
probably means, frankly,

Unknown Speaker  47:58  
asking

Unknown Speaker  48:01  
your girlfriend or your mother

Unknown Speaker  48:06  
can you remove these items tax? Don't

Unknown Speaker  48:11  
think I can do that. I

Speaker 3  48:13  
had to have that kind of these are Two times tempting. It undermines retreat. I think

Unknown Speaker  48:24  
table,

Unknown Speaker  48:40  
I so these things are gonna tempt you.

Speaker 2  48:54  
How do we save your life? We're not gonna save your life if you've got things just lying around a belt that you've actually tried out,

Unknown Speaker  49:03  
just sitting there tempting.

Unknown Speaker  49:07  
You don't have to do that.

Speaker 2  49:10  
I'm telling you, if we're going to save your life, we've got to make your environment less lethal,

Unknown Speaker  49:15  
and that means the things that tempt you have to

Unknown Speaker  49:19  
be made safe, put away.

Unknown Speaker  49:22  
No, I mean, I do get that, I get that.

Speaker 2  49:32  
I'm trying that. But this is really, actually not negotiable. We really do tender for environment. So

Speaker 3  49:39  
for starters, I would want to see what the because I

Unknown Speaker  49:53  
don't think it's

Speaker 9  50:00  
an unreasonable request. No, I mean, I do, I do follow what you're saying. Can I? Can

Unknown Speaker  50:05  
I talk about,

Unknown Speaker  50:07  
can I just throw stuff out? Sure. All right, so

Speaker 9  50:14  
if, all right, let's do, let's, let's think about knives. So like, I don't want my girlfriend's mom to know that I'm dealing with this, because she already thinks that I'm

Unknown Speaker  50:29  
kind of like a terrible person. I understand, so

Unknown Speaker  50:33  
I can't think of a way to secure it without her knowing. I guess maybe unless I

Unknown Speaker  50:45  
maybe, unless my girlfriend asked her so, like, I

Unknown Speaker  50:51  
don't really know what that would I could talk about,

Unknown Speaker  50:56  
end up deciding to give this a shot.

Unknown Speaker  50:59  
It could get something

Unknown Speaker  51:02  
come up, an explanation for her mom about why we moved

Speaker 8  51:04  
the knives or something like that.

Unknown Speaker  51:11  
So a conversation knives.

Unknown Speaker  51:20  
I mean, she already knows, like she

Speaker 2  51:22  
saw me with the knife yesterday, so it's not gonna be a big shock, right? Yeah, in some ways, Kevin, it's almost, I mean, I literally want you not to have access to lethal means. But if the particular knife that you chose gets removed, maybe that's what we do. Maybe that's a realistic compromise. I don't want what you ever to be in a position with that particular knife again, and maybe that's a step in a shared

Unknown Speaker  51:43  
effort to trust each I

Speaker 9  51:47  
get that. Okay, that makes that feels good to me. Like maybe talking to her about getting rid of that knife, but not like moving her mom's knife set where she's gonna ask a lot of questions,

Unknown Speaker  51:56  
okay, she probably

Speaker 9  51:57  
wouldn't even notice that that one knife was gone. And the belt, I mean, I need to work out like

Unknown Speaker  52:05  
I want my pants

Unknown Speaker  52:10  
from it, though I don't really

Unknown Speaker  52:14  
know what to do about that. This

Speaker 9  52:24  
is a really critical item in terms of getting out of the hospital.

Speaker 3  52:27  
You gotta get a gun. The gun would have to be removed. But, you know, the guns could use.

Speaker 9  52:35  
Biggest deal in world, I guess. I guess, if I decide to do this treatment, you're saying like 12 sessions or less. Yeah, that's what, like three months or something, four months at most, I feel like, if, if I decide, maybe I

Unknown Speaker  52:47  
could go without about three months, maybe that's not a good deal.

Unknown Speaker  52:51  
And that, to me, feels like a good faith

Speaker 1  52:53  
willingness to give this maybe, maybe a go. One

Speaker 2  53:00  
of the things that you're embarrassed about is that you don't have better ways of coping. I of coping. This would be an intervention that involves

Unknown Speaker  53:06  
developing a much better skill set

Speaker 2  53:10  
than, I think, what you're inclined to do. But that would really mean coming up you and I, coming up with ideas of things that you could do differently, that are

Unknown Speaker  53:19  
healthy for you, that

Speaker 2  53:20  
don't make things worse. What do you know about coping what kind of coping strategies and I come up with together if you were to get in trouble? So part of this idea if we make your environment safer, and then you do get into a dark moment, that there would be things that you would try

Unknown Speaker  53:36  
to do, short of taking your life. So what

Speaker 2  53:43  
is like yesterday? I would have done this instead of pushing exactly you actually would have gone. You would have gone through 12345, things that we would negotiate that's designed to redirect you or distract you, remind you why taking

Unknown Speaker  53:56  
your life is not right now at least the thing to do. So,

Unknown Speaker  54:03  
what do you know about coping? I

Unknown Speaker  54:04  
mean, I got ideas, but what do you what would you what occur to you?

Speaker 4  54:18  
I don't know. I mean, that was the only thing that came up at the moment. Yes,

Unknown Speaker  54:22  
I can't even think of doing something else yesterday.

Speaker 3  54:24  
So there's the problem, you don't have a repertoire. You

Speaker 2  54:29  
don't have other things in mind. Yeah, that could get you when you're upset like that, yeah, it's like a jump there. You just go, right there. I get that. And so before going right there, we want to put a few layers of things to do instead.

Unknown Speaker  54:41  
So

Unknown Speaker  54:45  
you could do therapeutic

Unknown Speaker  54:46  
push ups without a knife under you.

Unknown Speaker  54:47  
Can you exercise?

Speaker 4  54:51  
Yeah, I do feel better when I exercise. Well, I'm gonna propose that's, is it weird that I felt kind of good yesterday?

Speaker 2  54:58  
That's feeling like, wow, I actually did way more push ups than I thought. Well, there's all kinds of physiological things that go along with exercise, so exercising would be

Speaker 8  55:06  
a perfectly good thing to have under cooking list. What else

Speaker 6  55:18  
can you make this be stopped? And that's exactly the problem here.

Unknown Speaker  55:23  
I guess I could

Unknown Speaker  55:24  
watch some more breathing band

Unknown Speaker  55:28  
keeps you going.

Speaker 4  55:31  
But then that's kind of, I don't know. I don't know what to do in that one job. How far along? Like a season and a half? So I got, I don't know exactly how many seasons. It's

Unknown Speaker  55:41  
like three and a half seasons to go maybe like four and a

Unknown Speaker  55:43  
half. So we got a few more seasons. Yeah,

Unknown Speaker  55:48  
I got a fear. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  55:54  
your journal your written?

Unknown Speaker  55:59  
Would you go on to try?

Unknown Speaker  56:01  
What would I write about?

Speaker 2  56:04  
What's going on with you, what's happening in here, what you're thinking and feeling. It's very common in therapy to get people to journal or to blog as

Speaker 4  56:15  
part of the therapeutic process. It doesn't make sense to

Unknown Speaker  56:19  
me, because it feels like you would just be dwelling on stuff.

Speaker 2  56:22  
I would guide you and give you some suggestions about how to redirect some of your thinking, but

Unknown Speaker  56:27  
it might just be initially kind of focusing on what's on.

Unknown Speaker  56:40  
Anything Do

Unknown Speaker  56:42  
you have friends, any supports? No, not really.

Speaker 4  56:49  
I moved out here not too long ago to be with my daughter from

Unknown Speaker  56:53  
from Colorado. Okay,

Unknown Speaker  56:59  
so that's something like I need to work on, is

Unknown Speaker  57:01  
having you have more than just one person.

Unknown Speaker  57:09  
Other activities

Unknown Speaker  57:12  
you can't get any if I gave you

Unknown Speaker  57:15  
a book,

Unknown Speaker  57:17  
that would be if you

Unknown Speaker  57:21  
sort of look at things differently, would that be something

Unknown Speaker  57:22  
you could consider even reading a page or two? Yeah. So

Speaker 2  57:34  
one more thing do you ever take, like a hot shower? You know? Do you ever go for a walk?

Speaker 6  57:41  
Just do something to distract yourself, or would you want to try?

Unknown Speaker  57:46  
Yeah, I like to walk to like,

Unknown Speaker  57:50  
I like, I like

Unknown Speaker  57:52  
tech stuff. So like, I like walking. We have a Best Buy Neptune,

Speaker 8  57:54  
like browsing and looking at phones and stuff. Okay, let's put it down.

Unknown Speaker  58:00  
Walk to Best Buy,

Unknown Speaker  58:04  
look at textile.

Speaker 2  58:06  
Now, this isn't a static thing. Kevin, if you if you were to do this, we might continue to craft this. Some of these things might work. Some of them at work. We might discover other things that work better. But here's the bottom line, if you were going to do this treatment with me, which I'm hoping that I can convince you to

Speaker 3  58:22  
do, you're going to actually do these things when you get

Speaker 2  58:25  
in a fight and a desperate straight and it's really life and death like it was yesterday, that's your cue

Unknown Speaker  58:34  
to know this is an emergency, and that's when you Call me,

Unknown Speaker  58:41  
or also give you a hotline number,

Speaker 2  58:46  
and before you were to do something especially that would take your life for the time that you're

Unknown Speaker  58:52  
in this treatment, you would actually reach out for help. And again,

Speaker 1  59:00  
Isn't it worth maybe giving this a go? I mean, why not

Speaker 8  59:08  
everything? Again, nothing to lose. If you're talking about death forever, why wouldn't we give this a go?

Unknown Speaker  59:17  
Yeah, I guess that makes sense. It's

Unknown Speaker  59:20  
I know you're reluctant, but this is a therapeutic model that's

Unknown Speaker  59:23  
actually helped a lot of

Unknown Speaker  59:24  
people just like you. I don't

Unknown Speaker  59:32  
relish getting calls in the middle of the night, but you're in this

Speaker 1  59:35  
kind of straight if it's two in the morning, you call me really

Speaker 2  59:42  
and we'll walk you through it, and for some reason, I'm out of town, you'll call the hotline and they'll walk you through it. And that's essentially what keeps you in the hospital, is that you're committed to the stabilization plan and you're willing to give it a go. Not forever.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:01  
I'm gonna post three months,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:04  
and we can turn over every stone you

Unknown Speaker  1:00:06  
get to be dead for a long time.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:08  
So do I that

Speaker 8  1:00:11  
makes that makes sense. Okay, so this is my cell phone, and

Unknown Speaker  1:00:19  
this is the national lifeline number.

Speaker 2  1:00:25  
I You use it when you've done all these things faithfully,

Speaker 1  1:00:31  
and if you get here, that's a true emergency, and that's when you know to call me, okay,

Speaker 2  1:00:39  
you are way too isolated. Is there anybody that we can think of to decrease your isolation. Is there an acquaintance that you've

Unknown Speaker  1:00:47  
met, a neighbor, a cousin,

Unknown Speaker  1:00:49  
narrative, none.

Unknown Speaker  1:00:53  
So we got to work on this. Is

Unknown Speaker  1:00:56  
there somebody that you can

Unknown Speaker  1:00:59  
from back in Colorado that you

Unknown Speaker  1:01:00  
can call or text or not really.

Speaker 2  1:01:07  
Are any friends out there? Either? Okay, from childhood, high school.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:14  
So clearly, this is something that we really need to work on.

Speaker 2  1:01:17  
So much more burden on the relationship, and you bet your girlfriend's the

Unknown Speaker  1:01:22  
only person that you're really attached to, yeah, maybe,

Speaker 2  1:01:30  
right, and it just puts undue pressure on the relationship. And if you're suspicious for being faithful, it's

Unknown Speaker  1:01:36  
going to make that even more intense.

Unknown Speaker  1:01:41  
Are there any barriers to you coming to treatment,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:46  
not really. I mean, if I decided I want to do it,

Unknown Speaker  1:01:52  
transportation, and I live pretty close,

Speaker 1  1:01:54  
like a walk, so that's not really a big deal.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:01  
My girlfriend said that

Unknown Speaker  1:02:03  
she'd help with cost.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:06  
So All

Speaker 2  1:02:12  
right, so we've got a stabilization plan that needs some work, but it's a foot in the door as far as I'm concerned, and so I'm going to say that our stabilization plan is complete. I'm actually gonna give you a copy of this, or if you've got a smartphone, you take a picture of it. But I really want you to actually have this with you, or on your person or on your phone, and to actually refer to it when

Unknown Speaker  1:02:35  
you get in a state like you were in yesterday.

Unknown Speaker  1:02:41  
And we're closing three months

Unknown Speaker  1:02:44  
now, this is really important to this intervention,

Unknown Speaker  1:02:48  
and sort of makes sense to take stock.

Speaker 2  1:02:54  
What are the two problems, the drivers, as I said before, that

Unknown Speaker  1:02:59  
we'd have to fix

Speaker 1  1:03:01  
target and treat for you not to take your life

Unknown Speaker  1:03:08  
the two problems that most put your life in peril. I

Speaker 2  1:03:15  
mean, I feel like it would just be stuff we talked about. I feel like it would be what's, what's, what

Unknown Speaker  1:03:19  
is the number one thing that drives, I

Speaker 5  1:03:23  
don't know. I mean, I mean, I feel like it'd be a tie for one. I feel like it would be like

Unknown Speaker  1:03:29  
I hate myself, and people don't get

Speaker 1  1:03:33  
it, so self hate absolutely rings true. Yeah, 10

Unknown Speaker  1:03:38  
that time for me, for kids, right?

Unknown Speaker  1:03:42  
So self hate, absolutely

Speaker 2  1:03:43  
to me, that means we're gonna have to really attack that and look at the history of that, and look at how deep that runs, and where it comes from, and how it is sustained. And so we try to as

Unknown Speaker  1:03:55  
a goal, an

Unknown Speaker  1:03:56  
objective, to decrease your self hate,

Speaker 2  1:04:00  
to actually try to cultivate self esteem. And to do that, we've got a zillion things. There's

Unknown Speaker  1:04:07  
and this is the intervention part. In the three months, what we'll do, we're

Unknown Speaker  1:04:10  
going to do some insight oriented psychotherapy.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:16  
There's a something called Cognitive Behavioral

Unknown Speaker  1:04:18  
Therapy, or CBT, or exercises,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:21  
homework assignments.

Unknown Speaker  1:04:24  
You really think that's something that in three months? Oh yeah,

Speaker 2  1:04:28  
it works with most people, so yeah, but

Speaker 3  1:04:31  
whether it works with you or not is sort of what we're gonna find out. Right?

Unknown Speaker  1:04:38  
There's something called behavioral activation,

Unknown Speaker  1:04:40  
which is about getting you up and out

Unknown Speaker  1:04:42  
and doing things.

Speaker 2  1:04:46  
You know that, I mean, what's going on you're applying for jobs or looking for jobs, kind of, does that contribute to self hatred? Yeah, a little bit. Okay, so we can do some vocational counseling. There's a

Unknown Speaker  1:04:59  
lot of things that we can do to kind of chip away at selfie.

Speaker 2  1:05:03  
Yeah, I guess that's true well. And again, whether it works for you or not is something we'll find out together. But again, we're looking at three

Speaker 5  1:05:10  
months, and then this other problem,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:16  
people don't get it. People don't

Unknown Speaker  1:05:22  
get it. And what about that exactly makes you

Unknown Speaker  1:05:26  
Is it the vengeance thing you want to show them?

Unknown Speaker  1:05:30  
No, no, I feel like that's part of it. I feel like it's like,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:35  
I want them to get it. But

Unknown Speaker  1:05:39  
if it's never gonna happen, then I

Speaker 2  1:05:41  
guess I'll always like, feel that way, and it goes

Unknown Speaker  1:05:44  
to trust and not feel like you can trust people.

Unknown Speaker  1:05:50  
Probably, maybe you tell me,

Unknown Speaker  1:05:55  
maybe I'm not sure.

Unknown Speaker  1:06:05  
Yeah, probably we'll start with people don't get it. What trust?

Unknown Speaker  1:06:18  
Betrayal sounds, right? I

Speaker 8  1:06:25  
So goal would be to help people understand. Yeah, maybe find another way to make them get in, find ways to help others get it. Yeah, get it and

Unknown Speaker  1:06:49  
around betrayal,

Unknown Speaker  1:06:52  
insight or

Unknown Speaker  1:06:54  
increased trust,

Speaker 2  1:06:57  
something like that. Again, we don't have to this is not etched in stone. Every session we're going to revisit this, make sure this, in fact, are the things that we have to treat life

Unknown Speaker  1:07:08  
interventions.

Unknown Speaker  1:07:10  
I think there's probably some called

Unknown Speaker  1:07:13  
psychodynamic psychotherapy,

Speaker 8  1:07:17  
CBT, behavior activation, there's

Unknown Speaker  1:07:20  
group therapy.

Speaker 2  1:07:23  
Yeah, you're really reluctant about even doing this, but it's a concept that's a real great form, but that's that's probably bridge too far. We'll just stay with these for three months. I'll quickly prepare beyond my here

Unknown Speaker  1:07:38  
for me to think that, but I'm, I get

Unknown Speaker  1:07:41  
that you're reluctant. Okay? This

Speaker 2  1:07:45  
is your treatment plan. You are a co author of your treatment plan. I'm Wesley's provider. I'm Congressman

Speaker 3  1:07:50  
responsibly about this marketing thing from a forum, but we provide you

Unknown Speaker  1:07:59  
three months.

Speaker 3  1:08:02  
Yeah, yeah. UK came in, 111.

Unknown Speaker  1:08:16  
Yeah, you gotta be really curious. You

Unknown Speaker  1:08:28  
said earlier something like, you know,

Unknown Speaker  1:08:33  
Forever is a long time, or something like that. And I guess that's right. So I

Unknown Speaker  1:08:36  
feel like, why not? Might not give

Unknown Speaker  1:08:38  
it a go. I'm curious. So here's what

Speaker 2  1:08:41  
we're going to do. We're going to make photocopies of these for you to actually get a picture of it, if that is your preference, but I'm going to make a call that you're not in imminent danger. And this is as you saw in the forms, this is when hospitalizations indicated, but I'm making a professional judgment. Can that you're not in danger

Unknown Speaker  1:09:03  
because you're at least open to this

Unknown Speaker  1:09:16  
plan.

Unknown Speaker  1:09:23  
You are looking at

Unknown Speaker  1:09:26  
this maybe three months,

Unknown Speaker  1:09:28  
yeah, you got me for at least a couple of

Unknown Speaker  1:09:32  
sessions. Sessions isn't

Speaker 3  1:09:36  
enough give this give it a fair go. All right, yeah, I can three months we're talking,

Speaker 3  1:09:56  
yeah, any questions? No,

Speaker 2  1:10:11  
this first session was a kind of a tricky case. Kevin doesn't have a lot of resources. He's got a long history of thinking about suicide. He's pretty isolated, and he's overly dependent on his relationship. He's unemployed, living with his girlfriend's mother. It's not ideal, and he doesn't have much idea about how to cope, even in cases where patients are reluctant and don't want to be there in the first place, you see a way of engaging him that I pursued to get him to want to come back, I piqued his curiosity. He's curious about what I'm proposing, and

Unknown Speaker  1:10:49  
he's going to come back.

Speaker 3  1:10:52  
Let's talk about our next phase of a second session of interim care. You. care.
